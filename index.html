        <p>Thank you for visiting my site. My name is Alex Chao but I go by Chao. My pronouns are He/him. Currently I'm in the the great state of Washington. I have some college under my belt as a graphic designer and am a student/cohort of Code Fellows. My job experience includes being QA tester, hardware service technician, and some military experience as well. My goals right now is to complete Code Fellows and utilize what I've learned with them to help out with projects in mechanical engineering.</p>
